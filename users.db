     Project DescriptionWe are building a Healthcare Dental AI Analytics and Chatbot Platform aimed at transforming dental care using AI-driven insights and intelligent interaction.The platform will:Analyze dental X-rays, intraoral images, and clinical reports using Computer Vision (CV) and Natural Language Processing (NLP).Detect and classify a wide range of dental health issues including cavities, gum diseases, root infections, enamel erosion, misalignments, missing teeth, and other structural anomalies.Generate automated diagnostics, treatment suggestions, and personalized dental health reports for patients and clinicians.Offer a Conversational AI Chatbot capable of understanding patient queries, providing guidance, scheduling appointments, and explaining treatments and preventive measures.Key Technologies Required:Computer Vision:Object detection and segmentation for teeth structures, caries, periodontal diseases, pulp infections (e.g., using YOLOv8, Mask R-CNN, U-Net).Image preprocessing (denoising, normalization, contrast enhancement).Classification models (e.g., ResNet variants) for diagnosis.3D dental model reconstruction (optional advanced feature).NLP and LLMs:Fine-tuned LLMs (e.g., Llama 3, Mistral) for dental and healthcare-focused conversational flows.Medical domain adaptation and prompt engineering.Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for pulling context from dental health literature and clinical guidelines.Reinforcement Learning:RLHF (Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback) to align chatbot responses with professional dental advice and empathetic interaction styles.Backend and APIs:Python (FastAPI/Django REST) for core services and APIs.NodeJS (optional) for real-time communications and event handling.Frontend:ReactJS/NextJS for dynamic, user-friendly patient and clinician dashboards.Cloud and DevOps:AWS (EC2, S3, SageMaker, Lambda) or GCP for scalable hosting, storage, model training, and deployment.Docker and Kubernetes for containerization, scaling, and orchestration.Databases:PostgreSQL for structured medical records and patient data.Vector databases (Pinecone, Weaviate) for storing embeddings and semantic search capabilities.Analytics and Reporting:Real-time dashboards for clinicians using tools like Plotly, Grafana.Longitudinal tracking of patient dental health trends.Compliance and Security:HIPAA-compliant architecture.Data encryption (at rest and in transit).Role-based access control and audit logging.https://{your_url}.pwskills.app:5000/ Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://127.0.0.1:8000/ask" -Method Post -Body '{"question": "What is the capital of France?"}'
