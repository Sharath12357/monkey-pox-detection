Monkeypox Disease Detection Using Deep Learning
📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on the early detection of Monkeypox using image-based classification through deep learning models. The main goal is to build a reliable system that can classify skin images as either Monkeypox or non-Monkeypox, assisting healthcare professionals in faster decision-making.

🚀 Features
📷 Image Classification of skin lesions (Monkeypox vs Non-Monkeypox)

🧠 Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for model training

🧼 Data preprocessing and augmentation using OpenCV and TensorFlow

📊 Model evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score

📁 Web deployment ready (Flask or Streamlit can be integrated)

📦 Easy to extend with other skin disease datasets

🛠️ Tech Stack
Python

TensorFlow / Keras

OpenCV

NumPy / Pandas

Matplotlib / Seaborn

(Optional: Flask / Streamlit for deployment)

🧪 Dataset
✅ Collected from Kaggle or publicly available Monkeypox skin image datasets

🧼 Preprocessed using resizing, normalization, and augmentation (rotation, flip, etc.)
